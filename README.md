# Sokoban Solver using AI Search Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project models the Sokoban game as a search problem and solves it using classic AI search algorithms. In Sokoban, the player must push boxes onto designated target cells in a grid-based environment. The challenge lies in avoiding deadlocks and finding an efficient sequence of moves.

## Core Components
- **State Representation**: Formal definition of states including positions of the player and all boxes
- **Action Model**: Legal movements of the player and box-pushing mechanics
- **Transition Function**: Rules for generating successor states
- **Goal Test**: Verification that all boxes are located on target cells
- **Cost Function**: Step-based or uniform cost for search algorithms

## Core Environment
- Grid-based Sokoban environment (N × M) with walls, player, boxes, and target cells.  
- State is defined by the positions of the player and all boxes.  
- Actions include moving and pushing boxes (no pulling allowed).  
- Goal: place all boxes on target cells.

## Implementation Requirements
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) (or Depth-Limited Search as an alternative)
- A* Search with a well-defined heuristic function

## Learning Objectives
- Model real-world problems as state-space search problems  
- Implement and compare uninformed and informed search algorithms  
- Design admissible and consistent heuristic functions  
- Analyze algorithm performance in terms of optimality and efficiency  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame library (for visualization)
